Area of Expertise #20
--------------------
Expertise Title: Allergy Testing
Expertise Content: Allergy testing is a diagnostic procedure used to identify specific allergens that trigger allergic reactions in individuals. There are two primary methods of allergy testing: 1. Skin Prick Test: This involves placing small amounts of allergens on the skin, usually on the forearm or back, and lightly pricking (usually Painless) the skin so the allergen enters the outer layer. If a person is allergic to the substance, a small raised bump (wheal) surrounded by a red area (flare) will appear within 15-20 minutes. 2. Blood Test (Allergen-specific IgE Test): This test measures the level of specific IgE antibodies in the blood that react to specific allergens. It is often used when skin testing cannot be performed, such as in patients with severe skin conditions or those taking certain medications. As an allergist, I conduct allergy testing to accurately diagnose allergies and develop personalized treatment plans. The results guide allergen avoidance strategies, allergen immunotherapy (allergy shots), or medication management to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life for my patients.

Area of Expertise #21
--------------------
Expertise Title: Component Resolved Diagnostics
Expertise Content: Component resolved diagnostics (CRD) is an advanced allergy testing method used to identify specific proteins (components) within allergens that trigger allergic reactions. Unlike traditional allergy tests that detect whole allergen extracts, CRD provides detailed information about which components of an allergen an individual is sensitized to. This information is crucial for diagnosing complex allergies, such as cross-reactivity between related allergens or distinguishing between genuine allergy and sensitization. As an allergist, I utilize CRD to enhance the accuracy of allergy diagnosis and tailor personalized treatment plans for my patients. By identifying specific allergenic components, CRD helps me recommend targeted allergen immunotherapy (AIT) and optimize allergen avoidance strategies. This approach ensures more precise management of allergic conditions, leading to better symptom control and improved quality of life for individuals with allergies.

Area of Expertise #22
--------------------
Expertise Title: Spirometry
Expertise Content: Spirometry is a common pulmonary function test used to assess lung function by measuring the amount and speed of air that can be inhaled and exhaled. It helps diagnose and monitor conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other respiratory disorders. During spirometry, the patient breathes into a device called a spirometer, which records airflow patterns and volumes. As an allergist and respiratory specialist, I use spirometry to evaluate lung health, detect airflow limitations, and monitor response to treatment. The test provides valuable information such as forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and the FEV1/FVC ratio, which are critical in diagnosing lung diseases and assessing severity. I interpret spirometry results to guide treatment decisions, educate patients on lung function, and empower them to manage respiratory conditions effectively.

Area of Expertise #23
--------------------
Expertise Title: Forced Oscillometry Test
Expertise Content: Forced oscillometry (FOT) is a non-invasive pulmonary function test used to assess lung function by measuring how the lungs respond to pressure oscillations during breathing. Unlike spirometry, which relies on forced manoeuvres like rapid inhalation and exhalation, FOT uses small pressure oscillations to measure resistance and reactance within the respiratory system. As an allergist and respiratory specialist, I use forced oscillometry to evaluate lung function in patients who may have difficulty performing traditional spirometry manoeuvres, such as young children, elderly patients, or those with severe respiratory conditions. FOT provides valuable information about airway resistance, reactance, and lung mechanics, helping to diagnose and monitor asthma, COPD, and other respiratory disorders. I interpret FOT results alongside other clinical assessments to tailor treatment plans, monitor disease progression, and optimize respiratory care for my patients.

Area of Expertise #24
--------------------
Expertise Title: Allergen Immunotherapy
Expertise Content: Allergen immunotherapy, also known as allergy shots or desensitization therapy, is a treatment method aimed at reducing allergic reactions to specific allergens. It involves administering gradually increasing doses of allergens to patients over time, with the goal of desensitizing their immune system and reducing symptoms associated with allergic conditions. As an allergist, I recommend allergen immunotherapy for patients with moderate to severe allergic rhinitis (hay fever), allergic asthma, atopic eczema or insect venom allergies that are not well-controlled with medications or allergen avoidance alone. The treatment typically involves an initial build-up phase where allergen doses are increased gradually under medical supervision, followed by a maintenance phase with regular sublingual drops or sublingual tablets. Allergen immunotherapy works by altering the immune response to allergens, leading to decreased sensitivity and reduced symptoms over time. It is a long-term treatment approach that can provide lasting relief and potentially modify the course of allergic disease. I monitor patients closely throughout treatment, adjust doses as needed, and educate them on allergen avoidance strategies and managing potential side effects. My goal is to improve quality of life by effectively managing allergies and reducing reliance on symptomatic medications.

Area of Expertise #25
--------------------
Expertise Title: Inhaler therapy for Asthma
Expertise Content: An inhaler is a device used to deliver medication directly into the lungs to relieve symptoms of asthma. There are two main types of inhalers: 1. Reliever Inhalers (Short-Acting Bronchodilators): These inhalers provide quick relief by relaxing the muscles around the airways, making it easier to breathe during an asthma attack or flare-up. They are typically used on an as-needed basis to relieve symptoms like wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. 2. Controller Inhalers (Long-Term Control Medications): These inhalers contain medications such as corticosteroids, long-acting beta agonists (LABAs), or combination medications that help reduce inflammation in the airways and prevent asthma symptoms from occurring. They are used regularly to manage and control asthma over the long term, reducing the frequency and severity of asthma attacks. As an allergist and respiratory specialist, I prescribe inhalers based on the severity of asthma symptoms and individual patient needs. I educate patients on how to use inhalers correctly, including proper inhalation techniques and maintenance of the device. It's essential for patients to understand the role of each type of inhaler in managing their asthma effectively, ensuring they have access to quick relief and long-term control of their condition.

Area of Expertise #26
--------------------
Expertise Title: Nebulization
Expertise Content: Nebulization is a method of delivering medication directly into the lungs as a fine mist using a nebulizer device. It is commonly used to treat respiratory conditions such as hyperactive airway disease, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory infections. During nebulization, liquid medication is placed into the nebulizer reservoir. The device then converts the medication into a mist that can be inhaled through a mouthpiece or mask. Nebulizers are particularly useful for patients who have difficulty using inhalers, such as young children, elderly individuals, or those with severe respiratory distress. As an allergist and respiratory specialist, I prescribe nebulization therapy based on the patient's condition and treatment needs. Nebulized medications can include bronchodilators to relieve acute symptoms like wheezing or shortness of breath, as well as corticosteroids or antibiotics for managing chronic respiratory conditions or infections. I educate patients and caregivers on how to use the nebulizer effectively, ensure proper cleaning and maintenance of the device, and monitor treatment response closely. Nebulization provides an effective way to deliver medications directly to the lungs, improving symptom control and overall respiratory health for patients with respiratory disorders.
