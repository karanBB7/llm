Title: Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF) Surgery
Content: I am writing this review with immense gratitude for the exceptional care and expertise provided by Dr. Murali Mohan, a true savior in the realm of neurosurgery. Two years ago, I found myself grappling with debilitating back pain, which eventually led to the diagnosis of a slip disc/disc prolapse at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels. The pain had become so severe that simple tasks like getting out of bed or standing for more than a few minutes seemed unbearable. My left leg had become numb, with sensations akin to electric currents coursing from my back to my leg. The discs had protruded, causing impingement on the nerve near the spine. Dr. Murali Mohan entered my life at just the right time, offering not only medical expertise but also a reassuring presence. He confidently assured me and my worried parents that the situation could be resolved, allowing me to resume a normal life. The recommended Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF) procedure was explained with utmost clarity and executed flawlessly by Dr. Mohan. The surgery experience was surprisingly smooth. Dr. Mohan's dedicated team provided unwavering assistance and care, ensuring a pain-free discharge as promised. The stitches caused minimal discomfort, and I was encouraged to walk the day after the surgery. To my amazement, I experienced increased mobility and was happily discharged just two days post-surgery, comfortably enduring a one-hour journey from the hospital to home. In the initial month, I exercised caution due to slight heaviness from the stitches, but remarkably, there was no pain. Today, as I celebrate the completion of three months post-surgery, I can confidently declare that I am not just fine but living life to the fullest. I walk 10,000 steps a day, engage in workouts, and embrace each day with gratitude. As a 28-year-old, I couldn't have asked for a better outcome. Dr. Murali Mohan and his team played a pivotal role in making this entire process seamless and pain-free. My heartfelt thanks to the doctor and his team for restoring my health and enabling me to reclaim my life.

Title: Brain Tumor
Content: It's difficult for me to put into words how deeply grateful, respectful and impressed I am with Dr. Murali Mohan. He is not only an outstanding neurosurgeon but also an extraordinary individual who gave hope, confidence, and healing to his patients. My father, aged 74, faced challenges with walking(imbalance) and experienced a decline in responsiveness and overall weakness over the past eight months. Even after seeing a few doctors, we couldn't figure out what was wrong until we met Dr.Murali Mohan. Upon Dr.Murali Mohan's diagnosis, we discovered the presence of a tumor, necessitating surgery. This news naturally brought about considerable concern within our family. We were very worried about the surgery, thinking about the factor as my father's age is 74 However, Dr Murali Mohan's clear communication and thorough explanation of the situation, including the potential benefits and risks of the surgery, instilled in us the confidence to proceed. The eight-hour surgery went well, and a month later, I'm happy to say that my dad is doing great. He's much stronger now and can walk without any problems. I want to thank not just Dr. Murali Mohan but also the whole team at People Tree Hospital. They took care of us and supported us through this tough time. Dr. Murali Mohan is not just a great doctor; he's a kind person who made a big difference in our family. In short, words can't fully express how thankful we are. We appreciate all the care and help they gave us.

Title: Kyphoplasty
Content: Hello I am Niharika.N. My 12 year old sister Shree Siri.N had constant back pain and later we found she's suffering from Spine related issue. We also got to know that she had a chance of being paralyzed as she had her spinal bone compression. From the past 1 year we have done multiple tests. But we found no solution for her bone compression. Fortunately in the month of May 2023 we had been to Synapse Neuro Centre, Jaynagar and consulted Dr Murali Mohan Sir who is a Neuro and Spine Surgeon having 15+ years of experience. She was diagnosed for Multiple Level Vertebral Bone Collapse Fracture with Osteogenesis Imperfecta. My sister was advised to go for a medical surgery called Balloon Kyphoplasty at Multiple Levels. Till we met him, we had no hope that our baby girl could be alright in the days to come. But after consulting him, he became our pillar of strength. Through his advice, guidance and support we found our hopes back. Dr Murali Mohan Sir is the Consultant Neurosurgeon and Director of the Department of Neurosciences at People Tree Hospital, Yeshwantpur who has successfully completed over 7000+ surgeries. In July 2023, my sister was admitted to the People Tree Hospital, Yeshwantpur for her surgery. She underwent D6 to L5 - totally 11 levels of Kyphoplasty surgery. Surgery almost went for 6-7 hours long. It was not just a challenge for us but also for the surgeon and the team members to operate this 11 levels of surgery for the 1st time. We are grateful to the Surgeon and to the complete team for patiently operating such a major surgery for hours together. Also we are thankful to the staff members of People Tree Hospital who took excellent care of us. Dr. Murali Mohan Sir, we can't thank you enough for the special, excellent care you have provided us. You were our pillar of strength during this hard phase. You have supported us and made us mentally strong and you are our constant guide. When we consulted Dr. Murali Mohan Sir for the 1st time we had TEARS OF PAIN thinking about our baby girl's life. Now after her surgery, she is doing absolutely fine and we left the hospital thanking the team with the TEARS OF HAPPINESS. This is the change that Sir has bought in our lives. We are ever grateful for the support, help, care and guidance that you have provided us. You are so humble, generous, soft spoken, caring and a true leader leading the team and management well. Although this is such a long text, words are really short to explain the feeling we have towards you Sir. Thankyou😊. Vaidhyo Narayano Hari🙏.

ACDF( Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion) surgery was suggested for different levels . Because of this issue I was suffering with lot of pain Mentally, physically and emotionally I was very depressed. I consulted many good doctors nearly 6-7 doctors and I was really nervous and upset after getting to know that I have to undergo a major surgery for it. I also took Ayurvedic treatment which was of no use for me. Finally my search came to an end after I met Dr Murali Mohan who is an exceptional doctor who has immense knowledge and patience and was able to put my nervousness at ease. Dr Murali Mohan is a wonderful person just by talking to him anyone can feel very comfortable and half of my pain was healed by his words. No matter how many times my family and myself asked him questions and doubts he with full smile answered all questions patiently. I have no words to express what an amazing doctor he is . Anything I write here is not enough for him. After a lot of thought I finally decided to get my surgery done on May 20th in People Tree Hospital under doctor’’s supervision and his wonderful team. Each and every step was explained very well and my long hour surgery was successfully completed. Doctor’s coordinator Ms Ambica was also very helpful in the entire process.

Area of Expertise #3
--------------------
Expertise Title: Meningioma Surgery
Expertise Content: A meningioma is a tumour that grows from the meninges — the protective membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. Most meningiomas are benign (not cancer) and slow growing; however, some can be cancerous. They are slow growing and often take a long time to cause clinical symptoms. Brain scan such as an CT scan and MRI scan clinches the diagnosis. Surgical excision of the tumour is the first line of treatment, which often offers cure. Surgery is safe today, with use of high end operating microscopes, neuro navigation, intra-operative neurological monitoring and safe neuro-anesthesia.

Area of Expertise #4
--------------------
Expertise Title: Pituitary adenoma / Pituitary tumour
Expertise Content: Pituitary is the master gland of the body which controls all the other glands secreting hormones in our body. It is under the direct influence of the brain. This small pea sized gland can become a seat for tumour, known as pituitary adenoma. These tumours can cause visual field defects including blindness, headache, hormonal imbalance which includes infertility, cushing's disease, gigantism, acromegaly, galactorrhea, obesity or anemia. They can also cause sudden severe headache with sudden blindness including endangering life when they bleed within - known as pituitary apoplexy. These tumours can be cured by total surgical excision which are performed endoscopically through the nose - often referred to as transsphenoidal endoscopic excision. It is a safe, scar less procedure. With surgical treatment and often adjuvant hormonal replacement, a person with pituitary adenoma can lead a near perfect life, today!

Area of Expertise #5
--------------------
Expertise Title: Acoustic neuroma / schwannoma surgery
Expertise Content: Acoustic neuroma is a benign (non cancerous) tumour that occurs from the hearing nerve. These tumours grow to a big size and can press upon vital neuro structures such as the cerebellum and brainstem. They can also cause hydrocephalus, a condition where there is excess water within the brain. Early diagnosis offers excellent non surgical options such as radiosurgery. However, in large size tumours, surgical excision is required. Safe surgical excision with preservation of neurological functions including facial nerve functions and hearing preservation is possible with use of IONM (intra operative neuro monitoring).

Area of Expertise #6
--------------------
Expertise Title: Stroke / Golden hour in stroke
Expertise Content: Stroke can be reversed if you reach hospital with in ‘golden hour‘.Stroke is a devastating disease that cripples not only the person but the family.

Depending on specific cases this intervention can be performed up-to 12 hours.

Area of Expertise #7
--------------------
Expertise Title: Brain Hemorrhage / SAH / Aneurysm rupture
Expertise Content: A brain aneurysm (also called a cerebral aneurysm or an intracranial aneurysm) is a ballooning arising from a weakened area in the wall of a blood vessel in the brain. If the brain aneurysm expands and the blood vessel wall becomes too thin, the aneurysm will rupture and bleed into the space around the brain. Treatment includes Surgical clipping or Neuro-interventional coiling of the aneurysm, followed by treatment of vasospasm, cerebral edema and supportive care.

Area of Expertise #8
--------------------
Expertise Title: Awake Craniotomy for brain tumours; Glioma
Expertise Content: Brain tumours when they occur in very vital regions of the brain, can pose formidable challenge to the surgeon. Many a times, complete removal of the tumour can result in paralysis or loss of speech! Awake craniotomy is a technique, where the patient stays awake during the surgical procedure. Before the tumour is removed, the surface function of the brain is mapped by IONM - intra operative neuro monitoring. While the tumour is being operated and removed, the patient engages in conversation with surgical team, and is able to move the hands and legs. This way, the marked vital areas are avoided and only the safe zones are resected!

Area of Expertise #9
--------------------
Expertise Title: Trigeminal Neuralgia
Expertise Content: The main symptom of trigeminal neuralgia is sudden attacks of severe, sharp, shooting facial pain that last from a few seconds to about 2 minutes. The pain is often described as excruciating, like an electric shock. The attacks can be so severe that you're unable to do anything while they're happening. Evidence suggests that in up to 95% of cases, the cause of trigeminal neuralgia is pressure on the trigeminal nerve close to where it enters the brain stem. MVD ( Micro -vascular decompression) is the best choice of treatment. Its a day care / short stay procedure. In MVD, the offending vessel which is compressing the trigeminal nerve is dissected off from the nerve and is kept away by inter-positioning a teflon material.

Area of Expertise #10
--------------------
Expertise Title: DBS / Parkinson Disease / movement disorder

This condition can either occur as primary problem, or at times it occurs as a consequence to brain tumours or neuro infection. Traditional treatment involves placing the shunt tube connecting the ventricular cavity to the peritoneal cavity in the abdomen. Modern day alternatives includes Endoscopic surgeries such as third ventriculostomy, septostomy and aqueductoplasty. All are safe procedures, and can be done as daycare or short stay procedure.

Area of Expertise #13
--------------------
Expertise Title: Craniosynostosis
Expertise Content: Craniosynostosis is a condition where the skull bones fuse very early in life, resulting in small sized skull. This would impede the growth of the developing brain resulting in developmental delay, mental retardation, blindness, deafness and even can pose risk to life, apart from presenting as obvious deformity raising aesthetic concerns. Surgery is the only option here. Pediatric surgeries today are very safe. There are several procedures that are available today. From creating space between the bones, expand the skull to advancing the orbital sockets forwards, the surgical options are many.

C1/C2 instrumentation and distraction can stabilise the cranio vertebral junction (CVJ), resulting in correction of AAD.

Area of Expertise #15
--------------------
Expertise Title: Chiari Malformation / Syringomyelia Surgery
Expertise Content: Chiari Malformation is a congenital condition where there is herniation of brain matter into the cervical Spine ( Neck). Often this condition is associated with water accumulation within the Spinal Cord, known as Syringomyelia. This can lead to severe disability, paralysis and loss of muscle bulk in the hands along with loss of touch, pain and other sensory disturbance. This condition is essentially treatable. Foramen magnum decompression, along with C1/C2 fusion and Obexoplasty are choice of treatment. Early surgery can ensure reversal of symptoms and structural damage. Awareness is the key here.

Area of Expertise #16
--------------------
Expertise Title: Spinal cord tumour
Expertise Content: Tumours of the spinal cord can either arise from within or outside of the cord. They often present with pain, sensory issues and sometimes paralysis. A spinal tumor can be life-threatening and cause permanent disability. Microsurgical excision under IONM ( intra-operative neuro monitoring) is the mainstay of treatment. Complete functional recovery is practical, today. Along with surgery, radiation therapy & chemotherapy are adjuvant therapeutic options depending upon the nature of the tumour

Area of Expertise #17
--------------------
Expertise Title: Koch's Spine / Pott's Spine / Spinal TB / Tuberculosis
Expertise Content: Tuberculosis of the spine is still a major endemic issue in the developing world. Often these patients do not present with active chest tuberculosis. The caseation necrosis of tissues here, results in destruction of the spine resulting in gross instability. The granulomatous material and cold abscess can cause severe compression of the spinal cord. Effective treatment is decompression of the spinal cord, stabilisation of the spine, obtaining tissue for histopathological confirmation and followed by long term course of anti tubercular medications, with periodical followups.

Area of Expertise #18
--------------------
Expertise Title: Diastematomyelia / Split cord malformations / Neural tube defects
Expertise Content: The incidence of NTD's ( Neural tube defects) has largely reduced, today. This can be attributed to folic acid supplementation in early pregnancy. The NTD's include: Open defects such as Myelocele, Meningolcele, Myelomeningocele, and closed defects such as Spina Bifida, Lipomyelomeningocele and Diastematomyelia. Surgery can be safely performed in as early as first day of the baby's life, today. Often these condition causes tethering of the cord. Closure of the exposed wound with internalisation of the neural tissue, de-tethering of the tethered cord and neural tissue are main goals of the surgery. Early surgery can often restore neurological function.

Area of Expertise #19
--------------------
Expertise Title: Slip Disc
Expertise Content: Discogenic pain and associated Slip Disc issue has an high life time incidence in any given individual. This is largely attributed to the changing sedentary lifestyle, poor food habits, smoking and obesity that is prevalent in the current society!

Expertise Content: Scoliosis is a medical condition characterised by an abnormal sideways (lateral / coronal) curvature of the spine. While it can affect people of all ages, it is most commonly diagnosed in children and adolescents.Parents should watch for early signs of scoliosis in their children, especially during growth spurts. If any asymmetry is noticed in child’s shoulders, hips, or waist, a doctor consult for further evaluation is a must. Surgical correction of scoliosis, kyphosis and Spinal deformities are safe today. Advances in Neuro - anesthesia and intraoperative neuro monitoring have revolutionised this sphere. In today's world, Scoliosis need not hinder one’s quality of life if timely management is undertaken. This requires a larger awareness about this condition. By understanding the signs, seeking timely medical advice, and supporting awareness initiatives, we can make a significant impact on the lives of those affected by scoliosis.

Area of Expertise #21
--------------------
Expertise Title: Osteoporosis / kyphoplasty
Expertise Content: Osteoporosis or weak bones, is a natural phenomenon that happens with aging. The word ‘osteoporosis’ means ‘porous bone.’Weak bones results in fractures, delayed healing of fractures and often progression of fractures into non-union and deformity, especially in geriatric age group. Osteoporosis is called a “silent disease” because people who develop it may not notice any changes until a bone breaks — usually a bone in the hip, spine, or wrist.Spinal fractures do not heal as easily as elsewhere.The larger issue is instability of the spine, which in turn can result in injury to the spinal cord and consequent paralysis. An irreversible & miserable condition. Best treatment option would be kyphoplasty, a quick, simple, day care procedure, where the patient can return home in the same evening – pain free and walking! followed by appropriate medical management of Osteoporosis.

Area of Expertise #22
